<h1>Javascript Chips</h1>
<p class="lead">Discovering Javascript with <code>examples</code>.</p>
<p>Javascript is a beautiful and very powerful language. There are many different topics, patterns and implementations that show off Javascript like <a ui-sref="prototypes">prototypical inheritence</a>, <a ui-sref="prototypes">lexical scope</a> to the meaning of <a ui-sref="this"><code>this</code></a>.</p>
<p>The aim of this site is to present examples or "<span class="text-warning">chips</span>" of Javascript in all (well nearly all) its glory. Contributors are welcome in the form of pull requests. Fork me!</p>
